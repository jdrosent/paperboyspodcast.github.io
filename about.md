## Motivation:
*Paper Boys* started with the goal of sharing our excitement for science research with the public. There are lots of excellent science podcasts and news sources, but we feel *Paper Boys* offers something
unique: two researchers' perspectives on the actual experiments behind the headlines. We hope you enjoy hearing about really cool research and the stellar scientists who make it happen!

## About us

Hi I'm **Charlie**, a PhD student studying plasma physics and aerospace engineering. My research is aimed at using plasma as a propellant in rockets and as a tool for slowing satellites down when travelling
to other planets. A true space nerd, I got into this field out a passion for exploring the solar system (my favorite rover is Curiosity, obviously). I still want to be an astronaut when I grow up.

Hey everyone, I'm **James**. I'm a PhD student in electrical engineering with a concentration in wireless communication systems and neural engineering. I'm passionate about research that expands our understanding of the universe and our place within it. 
My focus is on new architectures for embedded wireless electronics to enable smaller, lighter, and lower power sensor systems for extreme environments like outer space and the brain. Favorite spacecraft? Voyager I and II (call me old fashioned).
