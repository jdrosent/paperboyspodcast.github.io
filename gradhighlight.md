## Grad Student Highlight
Each week, we highlight a graduate student to highlight their achievements and to bring a human touch to science that affects us all. Hear about their work in their own words in the episodes linked below.

**Jacob Adams**

Ph.D. student at MIT's Nuclear Science & Engineering Department.

Jacob's research is really cool (like, -400 degrees farenheit cool). At these very low temperatures, certain materials exhibit super conductivity, a state where their electrical resistance vanishes. Super conductivity has broad applications in research like nuclear fusion and even measuring small changes in the magnetic fields of neurons in your brain. Jacob's research is investigating how to develop a micro cooling device that could bring these super cool temperatures to applications outside of the lab.

**Alex Barth**

Ph.D. student studying inorganic chemistry at [Cal Tech](http://agapie.caltech.edu/).

One of the most important chemical reactions for life is called nitrogen fixation, which is making ammonia out of nitrogen gas in the air. People do this industrially to make things like fertilizer, but it takes immense temperatures and pressures and consumes ~2% of the world energy consumption. Nature is able to do so in bacteria at completely ambient conditions, and Alex's research is helping us to understand how!

**Jazmine Benjamin**

Biomedical science Ph.D. student in [Dr. Elizabeth Sztul's lab](http://apps.medicine.uab.edu/facultyDirectory/FacultyData.asp?FID=7713) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Jazmine studies membrane trafficing and protein degradation in the secratory pathway. By understanding these secratory pathways, Jazmine's research can gain insight into how diseases present themselves differently in different people, allowing us to develop new medications and treatments. She loves biology because it's the only science where multiplication is the same as division!
