## Grad Student Highlight

**Jazmine Benjamin**

*Biomedical science Ph.D. student in [Dr. Elizabeth Sztul's lab]* (http://apps.medicine.uab.edu/facultyDirectory/FacultyData.asp?FID=7713).
University of Alabama at Birmingham

Jazmine studies membrane trafficing and protein degradation in the secratory pathway. Her work focuses on building an interaction network for an important secratory pathway protein. This work is important because the secratory pathway is one of the ways that proteins communicate to each other. By understanding these secratory pathways, we can gain insight into how diseases present themselves differently 
in different people. She loves biology because it's the only science where multiplication is the same as division.
